## 🚀 What I Do

I'm a **self-made developer** who builds AI systems that actually work in the real world. No fancy CS degree, just pure passion and relentless learning. I create:

- 🧠 **AI-powered applications** that run both offline and online
- 🎨 **Custom frontends** with smooth UX that users love
- 🔧 **System automation tools** that make life easier
- 🗣️ **Voice-command interfaces** for hands-free computing

## 🎯 Current Mission

Building tools where **AI brains meet beautiful UIs**. I'm either going to land at a company where AI and frontend collide, or I'll build my own product startup. Currently diving deep into **system-level programming** and **cybersecurity** to level up my tech stack.

### 🔐 Currently Learning
- **Ethical Hacking** & **Cybersecurity** fundamentals
- **System-level programming** for performance optimization
- **Advanced automation** and **scripting** techniques

## 🎓 Research & Learning

Currently working on **malware detection research** comparing CNN/LSTM approaches against traditional ML models. I believe in learning by building—theory is great, but implementation is where the magic happens.

```python
research_focus = {
    "malware_detection": {
        "models": ["CNN", "LSTM", "Traditional ML"],
        "approach": "Practical implementation over theory",
        "goal": "Real-world applicable solutions"
    }
}
```

## 💼 Professional Goals

- 🎯 Build products that seamlessly blend **AI intelligence** with **intuitive UX**
- 🚀 Join a team where **AI meets frontend** or launch my own tech startup
- 🔒 Master **cybersecurity** and **system-level programming**
- 🌍 Create tools that solve real problems for real people

## 🌟 My Story

I didn't come from a privileged coding background—I built everything from scratch through **pure determination** and **relentless learning**. Every line of code I write represents hours of self-teaching, experimenting, and pushing through challenges. This isn't just a portfolio; it's my **tech identity** forged through grit and passion.
